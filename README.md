# Leak Pro

## Description

A household gas leak detection and alert system that when detected, shuts-off the gas supply automatically, thus preventing any major accidents without even having the need of a human intervention. This idea was built on a hardware prototype using different modules, which has helped us demonstrating our model to our peers, gaining valuable feedback for future improvements. 

## Materials Used

- Arduino Uno
- GSM-SIM900A 
- M2 Gas Sensor
- Servo Motor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- Gas Lighter
